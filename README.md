GDMP - Google Drive Music Player

Music player leveraging Google Drive API. GDMP(Google Drive Music Player) takes every audio file in your Drive and compiles them to a single website. Making it easier to listen to music in your Drive. Very useful if Music and Music players are blocked in your office. That's the reason I made this and its Dropbox counterpart, DBXMP. :)
